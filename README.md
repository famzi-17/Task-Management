[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Task Management System
Project Description
The Task Management System is an application designed to streamline and manage tasks efficiently. This system is developed using Flutter for the mobile app interface, PHP for server-side logic, and MySQL as the database to store task data. The application allows users to create, update, and manage their tasks, as well as track progress.

Key Features
User Authentication & Security
The system includes secure user authentication using passwords and encrypted communications to ensure data safety.

Task Management
Users can create, update, delete, and view tasks. Each task includes details such as title, description, deadline, and status.

Email Notifications
The system features email notifications for reminders, task updates, and account activities. PHP Mailer is used for sending emails securely.

Responsive Design
Developed using Flutter, the app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

Task Priority & Status
Users can assign priority levels to tasks and mark them as completed, in-progress, or pending.

Real-Time Updates
The system supports real-time task updates, ensuring that users always see the latest status of tasks.

Technologies Used
Flutter: For mobile app development (cross-platform support for Android & iOS).
PHP: Server-side backend logic and API handling.
MySQL: Database for storing tasks, user data, and metadata.
PHP Mailer: For secure and reliable email sending functionality.
XAMPP: Local development environment for running PHP and MySQL.
Composer: For managing PHP packages and dependencies.
Security: Implements best practices for password hashing, secure email transmission, and overall data protection.
Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
XAMPP must be installed on your local machine to run PHP and MySQL.
Composer must be installed for managing PHP packages.
PHP Mailer will be used for sending emails, so ensure the required configuration is set.
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository
Clone the project from the GitHub repository using the following command:

bash
Koobi-garee koodh
git clone https://github.com/username/task-management-system.git
Setup the backend (PHP + MySQL)

Extract the PHP files to the htdocs directory within XAMPP.
Create a new MySQL database and import the provided database schema.
Install PHP packages

Run the following command in the backend directory to install required PHP packages (including PHP Mailer):
bash
Koobi-garee koodh
composer install
Set up the Flutter app

Install Flutter SDK on your machine.
Open the Flutter project in your preferred IDE (e.g., VS Code or Android Studio).
Run the app on an emulator or a real device using the following command:
bash
Koobi-garee koodh
flutter run
Configure Email Settings

Edit the PHP Mailer settings to configure a valid SMTP server (e.g., Gmail, SendGrid, etc.) for email notifications.
Usage Instructions
After setting up the system, launch the Flutter mobile app.
Use the provided authentication credentials to log in.
Users can create and manage tasks through the app interface.
Notifications for task deadlines, updates, and activities will be sent via email.
Note
Ensure that PHP Mailer and other required dependencies are installed via Composer.
Make sure that XAMPP is running, and the MySQL database is configured correctly.
